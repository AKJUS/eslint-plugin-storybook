# eslint-plugin-storybook

Best practice rules for Storybook

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](https://eslint.org/):

```sh
npm install eslint --save-dev
# or
yarn add eslint --dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-storybook`:

```sh
npm install eslint-plugin-storybook --save-dev
# or
yarn add eslint-plugin-storybook --dev
```

## Usage

Add the following eslint configuration:

1. Add `storybook` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. Note that we can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

   ```json
   {
     "plugins": ["storybook"]
   }
   ```

   <details>
     <summary>Why not use the "extends" option?</summary>
     The "extends" option applies to <em>all</em> files you're linting against. The rules in this plugin are intended only for Storybook story files and would conflict with your other non-story files.
   </details>

2. Then, define which rule configurations to extend in your eslint config.

   > It's important to understand that **Storybook linting rules should only be run against your stories files**. You don't want these rules to affect your other filesâ€”such as production or test codeâ€”as they might conflict with rules from other ESLint plugins.

   There are two ways of doing this:

   1. #### ESLint `overrides`

      One way of restricting ESLint config by file patterns is by using [ESLint `overrides`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#configuration-based-on-glob-patterns).

      Assuming you are using the recommended `.stories` extension in your files, the following config would run `eslint-plugin-storybook` only against your stories files:

      ```javascript
      // .eslintrc
      {
        // 1) This applies to the whole project, so we don't put the storybook configuration here.
        "extends": ["airbnb", "plugin:prettier/recommended"],

        // 2) We load eslint-plugin-storybook globally with other ESLint plugins.
        "plugins": ["react-hooks", "storybook"],

        "overrides": [
          {
            // 3) Now we enable eslint-plugin-storybook rules or preset only for matching files!
            //    For the files glob, adjust the one from `.storybook/main.js` to be relative to your eslint config file.
            "files": ['./src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
            "extends": ["plugin:storybook/recommended"],

            // 4) Optional: You can override or disable specific rules here, if you want.
            "rules": {
              'storybook/no-redundant-story-name': 'error'
            }
          },
        ],
      };
      ```

   2. #### ESLint Cascading and Hierarchy

      If all your stories are placed under the same folder that contains only story files, another approach for customizing ESLint config by paths is through [ESLint Cascading and Hierarchy](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#cascading-and-hierarchy). Place another `.eslintrc` in that folder, where you enable `eslint-plugin-storybook` (this time via the top-level "extends" option). With this setup, you apply the plugin's rules only to the files in that folder, rather than enabling it on your global `.eslintrc`, which would apply to your whole project.
