# eslint-plugin-storybook

Best practice rules for Storybook

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](https://eslint.org/):

```sh
npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-storybook`:

```sh
npm install eslint-plugin-storybook --save-dev
```

## Usage

Add `storybook` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["storybook"]
}
```

Then, define which rule configurations to extend in your eslint file. Before that, it's important to understand that **Storybook linting rules should only be applied in your stories files**. You don't want rules to affect your other files such as production or test code as the rules might conflict with rules from other ESLint plugins.

### Run the plugin only against story files

We don't want `eslint-plugin-storybook` to run against your whole codebase. To run this plugin only against your stories files, you have the following options:

#### ESLint `overrides`

One way of restricting ESLint config by file patterns is by using [ESLint `overrides`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#configuration-based-on-glob-patterns).

Assuming you are using the recommended `.stories` extension in your files, the following config would run `eslint-plugin-storybook` only against your stories files:

```javascript
// .eslintrc
{
  // 1) Here we have our usual config which applies to the whole project, so we don't put storybook preset here.
  "extends": ["airbnb", "plugin:prettier/recommended"],

  // 2) We load eslint-plugin-storybook globally with other ESLint plugins.
  "plugins": ["react-hooks", "storybook"],

  "overrides": [
    {
      // 3) Now we enable eslint-plugin-storybook rules or preset only for matching files!
      // you can use the one defined in your main.js
      "files": ['src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
      "extends": ["plugin:storybook/recommended"],

      // 4) Optional: you can override specific rules here if you want. Else delete this
      "rules": {
        'storybook/no-redundant-story-name': 'error'
      }
    },
  ],
};
```

#### ESLint Cascading and Hierarchy

Another approach for customizing ESLint config by paths is through [ESLint Cascading and Hierarchy](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#cascading-and-hierarchy). This is useful if all your stories are placed under the same folder, so you can place there another `.eslintrc` where you enable `eslint-plugin-storybook` for applying it only to the files under such folder, rather than enabling it on your global `.eslintrc` which would apply to your whole project.
